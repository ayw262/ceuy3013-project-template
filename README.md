# Reinforced Concrete Beam Design

This is a program for reinforced concrete beam design.
The user inputs the compressive strength and yield strength of the concrete,
along with the intended dead and live loads and load factors.
This program will return the beam dimensions (width, height, effective depth)
and the size and number of reinforcing steel bars.

The values must be inputted without commas.
Permitted values for compressive strength:
  3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000
Permitted values for yield strength:
  40000, 50000, 60000, and 750000
