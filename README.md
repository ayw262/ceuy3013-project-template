# Reinforced Concrete Beam Design

This is a program for reinforced concrete beam design.
The user inputs the compressive strength and yield strength of the concrete,
along with the intended dead and live loads and load factors.
This program will return the beam dimensions (width, height, effective depth)
and the size and number of reinforcing steel bars.
