##Reinforced Concrete Beam Design

This is a program for reinforced concrete beam design.
The user inputs the compressive strength and yield strength of the concrete,
along with the intended dead and live loads and load factors.
This program will return the beam dimensions (width, height, effective depth)
and the size and number of reinforcing steel bars required.

All values must be inputted without commas.

Permitted values for compressive strength in psi:
  3000, 4000, and 5000 (5000 only works with 60000)

Permitted values for yield strength in psi:
  40000 and 60000
